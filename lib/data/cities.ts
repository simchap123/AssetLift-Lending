    overview: "Fort Myers and the broader Lee County market has been one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in Florida. Located on Florida's Gulf Coast, the market attracts retirees, snowbirds, and remote workers, creating sustained demand for both long-term rentals and short-term vacation properties. Hard money lenders are active across Fort Myers, Cape Coral, and Bonita Springs for fix-and-flip, DSCR, and bridge deals.",
    investmentHighlight: "Fort Myers offers investors a combination of appreciating home values, strong vacation rental demand, and more affordable entry prices than Miami or Tampa. The region's continued population growth and limited new construction support long-term rental fundamentals for buy-and-hold investors.",

      { question: "Is Fort Myers a good hard money market?", answer: "Yes. The Fort Myers area has consistent deal flow for fix-and-flip and value-add investors, particularly in older neighborhoods near downtown and the McGregor corridor. Insurance costs have risen significantly since 2022 storms and must be factored carefully into hold cost calculations." },
      { question: "How does vacation rental demand affect Fort Myers DSCR loans?", answer: "Strong vacation rental demand in Fort Myers and nearby Fort Myers Beach creates viable STR income for DSCR qualification on well-located properties. Lenders who accept short-term rental income typically require operating history or third-party market projections. Confirm STR lender availability before purchasing with this strategy." },
      { question: "What should investors watch in the Fort Myers market?", answer: "Insurance costs are the primary risk factor in this market after multiple hurricane seasons. Investors should obtain insurance quotes before closing — not after — and build higher insurance costs into their DSCR and holding cost models than would be typical in inland Florida markets." },

This makes Colorado Springs a particularly strong DSCR market." },
      { question: "What are hard money loan rates in Colorado Springs?", answer: "Colorado Springs hard money rates typically mirror the Denver metro — 9% to 12% with 1.5 to 2.5 points at closing. The Springs' lower property values mean smaller loan amounts, which may affect pricing with some lenders." },
      { question: "Is fix-and-flip viable in Colorado Springs?", answer: "Yes. Older neighborhoods near Fort Carson and in east Colorado Springs offer value-add inventory at prices below the metro median.
