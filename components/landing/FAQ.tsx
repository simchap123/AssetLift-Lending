      question: "What types of properties do you lend on?",
      answer: "We finance non-owner-occupied residential investment properties including single-family homes, 2-4 unit properties, condos, and townhomes. The most common use cases are fix and flip, bridge, DSCR rental, and ground-up construction files.",
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can you close?",
      answer: "Many deals can close in as fast as 7-14 business days, subject to underwriting, valuation, title, and file complexity. Experienced fix-and-flip investors with 3 or more completed flips may close in as fast as 5 business days, subject to underwriting, valuation, title, and file complexity.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are your minimum loan requirements?",
      answer: "Most programs start at $100,000 and go up to $5,000,000. We generally look for a 660+ credit profile, enough liquidity to support the deal, and a business plan that makes sense for the property and exit.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you require personal guarantees?",
      answer: "Yes. We typically require a full personal guarantee from all members with 20% or more ownership in the borrowing entity.",
    },
    {
      question: "What states do you lend in?",
      answer: "We lend in 46 states. If you are not sure whether your market fits our current footprint, reach out and we can confirm quickly.",
    },
